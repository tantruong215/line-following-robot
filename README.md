# Line Following Robot

A two-wheeled robot that follows a black tape track using IR sensors and PID control, designed to navigate turns and junctions autonomously.

---

### ⚙️ Hardware Design
- L298N motor driver + geared DC motors
- 5 IR reflectance sensors (TCRT5000)
- Arduino Nano + Li-ion battery

---

### 🧠 Control/Software Features
- PID loop for smooth trajectory correction
- Speed adjustment based on curvature
- Auto-stop on dead-end or finish line

---

### 📊 Results (Expected)
- Follow 90° turns with <5% deviation
- Complete 10m track in <30s
- Stability under lighting variations

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Arduino IDE, Embedded C
- Simulink (for prototyping)
- TinkerCAD for chassis mock-up

---

### 🚧 Project Status
🛠️ Status: In Progress – Summer 2025
